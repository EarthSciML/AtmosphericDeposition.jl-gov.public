This will allow us to have code that connects the wet and dry deposition code to SuperFast without always having to load the GasChem Package. The documentation is here: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#man-extensions\r\n\r\nBasically, the idea is that we can create a file named `/ext/GasChemExt.jl` (*not* `/src/ext/GasChemExt.jl`) in this repository, then in that file put:\r\n\r\n``` julia\r\nmodule GasChemExt\r\n\r\n... connector code from here: https://github.com/jialinl6/box_model/blob/c65a56a328d865c119f2148efabb9d72bc5641b7/s_f_d.jl#L6\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe, in `Project.toml` we can add: \r\n\r\n``` toml\r\n[weakdeps]\r\nGasChem = \"58070593-4751-4c87-a5d1-63807d11d76c\"\r\n\r\n[extensions]\r\nGasChemExt = \"GasChem\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n(Also add tests and documentation)","labels":["gov4git:managed"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":3},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
